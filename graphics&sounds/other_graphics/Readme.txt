Some new graphics for Dm Java. A few notes:- The green maps were my first atempt at a wall set and are a little off. The grey maps are more of an improvement but still need some work. The last ones I did were from the original graphics but with added colour and texture. The monters were ripped from Neverwinter Nights.

Models from NWN were ripped from the model viewer via screen capture then edited by Adobe Photoshop 7.

Please feel free to rework and edit anything you like. More to come, including wav's for monster sounds, footsteps for party, wall deko, doors....etc.

Also extracted some stuff from DM2....mons, doors deko.....
